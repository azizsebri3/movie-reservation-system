# 🎬 Movie Reservation System (Backend)

> Backend REST API built with **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **PostgreSQL** — currently under active development as part of my backend learning roadmap.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a **backend service** for a Movie Reservation System.  
It allows users to manage movies, showtimes, and (coming soon) seat reservations.  

I’m building it to **master backend engineering** concepts:
- CRUD operations with FastAPI  
- Database modeling with SQLAlchemy  
- Data validation using Pydantic v2  
- Relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-One)  
- REST API design best practices

🚀 Overview

This project is a backend service for a movie reservation system.
It allows users to manage movies, showtimes, and seat reservations (in progress).

I’m building it to master backend engineering concepts such as:

CRUD operations with FastAPI

Relational database modeling (SQLAlchemy ORM)

Data validation with Pydantic v2

One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships

Clean REST API design and error handling

## 📂 Current Features

### 🎞️ Movies
- Create, Read, Update, Delete movies  
- Schema-based validation  
- Clean error handling (404, validation, etc.)

### 🕒 Showtimes
- Linked to movies via `movie_id`  
- CRUD endpoints  
- Returns `movie_title` for each showtime  
- Pagination support (`skip`, `limit`)

### 💺 Reservation System

- Reservation model + service layer
- Seat generation and dynamic availability
- Validation and cancellation logic

## 🧱 Next Steps (in progress)

### 🔐 Authentication
- Implement JWT authentication  
- Add user roles (Admin / Customer)  
- Protect restricted routes  

### 🧰 DevOps
- Dockerize the app (FastAPI + Postgres)
- Unit tests with pytest  
- Deploy to Render / Railway
